# LINEL
The Linel is a simple word generator for a conlang (Constructed Language, an artificial language).
You need to modify the sounds.txt and the syllables.txt in order to provide the possible patterns of your conlang.
Put your patterns in the phonology folder.

# Usage

Run the python3 script:
```sh
$ python3 linel.py
```
The above only returns only 10 words by default.
```sh
$ python3 linel.py 40
```
The above returns 40 words.
